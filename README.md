# Feed Reader

a web-based application that reads RSS feeds that another developer has worked on, and write tests against it using Jasmine's testing syntax.

The required tests for the project (RSS Feed testing, RSS Feed properties, menu default state, and menu hiding/showing) are all provided and are comprehensive enough to adequately test the functionality.
